# Advanced Numerical Methods for Chemical Engineers - Term Project 
## Analysis of Advection-Diffusion of Voidage and Particle Velocity through a Gas-Fluidized Bed using Various Time-Integration Schemes

This project focusses on the understanding of the advection-diffusion of voidage and particle velocity in a gas-fluidized bed by using various time-integration schemes such as Forward in Time, Upwind in Space (FTUS), Backward in Time, Central in Space (BTCS) and Crank-Nicolson (Average of Forward and Backward in Time) in Time, Central in Space (CNCS). 

The results obtained and conclusion drawn from this project can provide a good foundation for critical analysis of bubble and slug formations in the gas-fluidized bed. 

## Getting Started

A detailed report of the project has been uploaded for further information. 

## Prerequisites 

To access this project, one is required to download Ipython notebook commonly called Jupyter Notebook. This notebook can be accessed by installing Anaconda Navigator. Here's the link to download the navigator: https://www.anaconda.com/

One has to an install extra modules to access certain features in Jupyter Notebook. For example, to enable LATEX, one has include LATEX NBextensions to the notebook. This information can be easily googled.

## Acknowledgment 

I thank Dr.James Sutherland for his constant guidance throughout the project and sharing his experience to make the project realizable within the stipulated time frame. 

I thank my advisor/mentor Dr.Jeremy Thornock for constant support and guidance. Provided the required encouragement and space for me to learn the fundamentals of this subject. 

#### Note: 
The project I have done is not totally correct/perfect. This is my first experience doing a project in numerical methods in python. Please free to jump if you have any suggestions. I am more than happy to recieve good feedback.
