## Analysis of Advection-Diffusion of Voidage and Particle Velocity through a Gas-Fluidized Bed using Various Time-Integration Schemes

This project focusses on the understanding of the advection-diffusion of voidage and particle velocity in a gas-fluidized bed by using various time-integration schemes such as Forward in Time, Upwind in Space (FTUS), Backward in Time, Central in Space (BTCS) and Crank-Nicolson (Average of Forward and Backward in Time) in Time, Central in Space (CNCS). 

The results obtained and conclusion drawn from this project can provide a good foundation for critical analysis of bubble and slug formations in the gas-fluidized bed.
